        <h1>My README.md</h1>
        <p>I'm a Computer Science student currently studying at Victoria University of Wellington, expected to graduate in November 2025. While architecting effective solutions is important to me, I also believe it is integral to consider ethics and accessibility best practises during development - I aim to contribute to meaningful projects which benefit the wider community.</p>
        <p>I possess an open mindset regarding new technologies and as such have delved into a variety of fields outside of my general scope, including network programming, AI development and cybersecurity. My main skills include Java, HTML/CSS/Javascript, Python, Typescript, PostgreSQL, AWS and Figma, as well as game engines such as Godot and Unreal Engine.</p>
        <p>Outside of development, I am currently participating in the Wellington Plus volunteering programme contributing to organisations such as InsideOut, as well as working and enjoying activities such as reading and writing.</p>
        <p>I currently work as a Student Ambassador at Victoria University of Wellington and as a tutor at Matamoe Hub delivering educational technology-related lessons to middle school-aged children.</p>
